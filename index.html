                            Bespoke to you and your guests, we tailor every detail of our dinner parties. No two events
                            are the same.

                            Using a coal-fired <em>Kamado Joe</em> imparts inimitable flavour into ingredients. Our BBQ
                            option can be chosen for an informal garden party or add that huge quintessential BBQ
                            flavour into elements of a more formal dinner party. Outdoor space is a must with this one.

                    vegetables.
